    "\n",
    "When reading text, understanding the type of entities within the text helps to infer additional information about the entity. For example, if a text mentions *Canada*, knowing that it is a GPE (geopolitical entity), already indicates to us that this entity has a supercify, a population, etc. Through the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER), we are able to determine whether an entity is a Person, Organization, Country, ... \n",
    "\n",
    "When exploring text online, we also occassionally see entities have clickable links to webpages with more information on the entity. This is a form of enhancement of the text to allow readers to easily access the information needed to understand each entity from the text and its content.  If we take the example of Canada again, if we transform it into [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada), using entity linking we access more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be revisiting the Covid-19 related news dataset from notebook 7 to explore how we can improve spaCy's NER and enhance the text from the news articles through the use of entity linking. This will be done in three parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) we explore the results of spaCy's NER  \\\n",
    "(2) we use text coherence for post-processing spaCy's NER results \\\n",
    "(3) we perform text enhancement with entity linking.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses libraries that have been used in previous notebooks, including spaCy and pandas. "

    "  \n",
    "As you saw in Q1, the results of spaCy are quite good, but not perfect.  One main issue with NER (not just in spaCy but in many tools) is that the annotation is performed one entity at a time without consideration of the overall document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But when looking a the whole document, and knowing that text is usually coherent, we can do some post-processing to spaCy's NER module and correct some mistakes.  By text being coherent, we mean, for example, that if a person is referred to with a particular name, e.g. *McGeer*, chances are that each time we see *McGeer* in the document, it is the same person.  All the mentions of *McGeer* form a coreference chain all refering to a single entity. So it is unlikely that *McGeer* would be once a person and once an organization.  This is not always true, there are numerous counter-examples, but it is a common assumption.  This idea is even the topic of an older much-cited NLP article called \"One sense per discourse\" (Gale and al. 1992). \n",
    "\n",
    "With this idea of \"one sense per discourse\", we will explore two different strategies to use text coherence to post-process the output from the spaCy NER module.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first strategy (*explored in Q2/Q3*) is to find, among all NER types assigned, which is the most frequent one.  For example, the name *Bourouiba* was assigned 1 time ORG, and 2 times PERSON, so this information can be used to modify the ORG type and change it to PERSON.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy (explored in Q4) is to try to find a longer surface form in the text.  Since that longer form should be less ambiguous, we can use it to disambiguate the shorter, more ambiguous forms.  For example, *Lydia Bourouiba* occurs in the text and is assigned PERSON.  We can use that information to assign further occurrences of the short form *Bourouiba* to also be PERSON.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, using these methods for text coherence will not work every time, and will unfortunately introduce some errors...  But let's try.  That's what empirical studies are about, we try ideas."

Now, we'll explore the idea that the least ambiguous reference to an entity (the actual text) could be the correct one.  For example, *McGeer* is more ambiguous (shorter form) than *Allison McGeer* (longer form).  Often the longer form of reference to an entity is the least ambiguous.  But because it is long to write, we often use it sparingly in a text (perhaps only once) and then subsequent references to the same entity will use the shorter form.  For example, the text might mention *Allison McGeer* once, and then use the short form *McGeer* to refer to the same person many times in the document.\n",

    "Your function will have the same *entity* and *entities* parameters, but this time the function must assign to *entity* the NER type of another entity in the *entities* iterator, that of the longest form found.   \n",

    "Specifically, you must look through *entities* to find a normalized form of *entity*. In this scenario, the longest entity that contains *entity* as a substring will be considered the normalized form and should be returned.  If no longer form is found, the entity itself *entity* should be returned.\n",
